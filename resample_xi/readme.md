workflow:
1. do pair counting for the late time snapshots and also ZA particles
2. for tetsize=4, resample with tetrahedra centers and do pair counting, save xi
3. for tetsize=8, resample 5 pts in each tet, save xi
4. repeat these for 4^3 and 8^3 shifts, both for simulation snap and for ZA pts
5. plotting
6. this will be done for Fiducial_ZA/0
7. repeat for all Fiducial_ZA
